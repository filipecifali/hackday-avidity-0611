# Repository Idea: Dynamic Music Generation Based on User Mood

This repository aims to explore the concept of generating dynamic music based on user input, specifically their mood. The project will involve creating a user interface to capture the user's mood and then using that input to influence the generation of music.

## Key Features:

*   **Mood Input:** A simple and intuitive UI for users to input their current mood.
*   **Music Generation:** An engine that can generate or select music that reflects the user's mood.
*   **Dynamic Playback:** The ability to play the generated music and potentially transition between different musical pieces as the user's mood changes.

## Potential Technologies:

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the user interface)
*   **Music Generation:** This could range from a simple pre-tagged library of music to more advanced algorithmic or AI-based music generation techniques.
